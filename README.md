# dev-core
software essential functional modules to harden codebases &amp; mitigate anti-patterns

DEV-CORE WAS BUILT UNDER ONE PRINCIPLE,
"DONT REPEAT YOURSELF".
DEV-CORE IS A CONTINOUS EFFORT ESTABLISHING A SOLID FOUNDATION
TO CONFIDENTLY WRITE SOFTWARE THAT DOES ITS AUTHOR INTENTIONS.
DEV-CORE'S PARADIGM IS PURELY FUNCTIONAL FOR THE SAKE OF
FUNCTIONAL CLARITY. DEV-CORE WILL BE THE FOUNDATION LAYER
THAT OOP PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN ON. OOP IS POWERFUL THO
EASILY IMPLEMENTED WRONG. TACKLING OOP WITH NO FUNCTIONAL BASE LAYER
EASILY PERSUADES OUR CODE ORGANIZATION, LEADING TO DUPLICATION, 
AND A BLOATED CODEBASE. OOP NAMING SYSTEMS SUFFER SUBJECTIVE POINT OF VIEWS. 
A PROGAMMER SHOULD NEVER LEAVE THE COMPUTERS POINT OF VIEW. COMPUTERS ARE BEING
HACKED EASILY BECAUSE OUR NAMING CONVENTIONS BLIND OUR REALIZATIONS
OVER INTENTIONS. USE THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. ALWAYS REMEMBER TO 
REMOVE YOUR SELF OR ELSE OBSERVATIONS ARE JUST POISONOUS
UNCONCIOUS STREAMS.

BEFORE DEV-CORE, THESE MERGED MODULES WERE INDEPENDENT FOLDERS.
NOW THEY ARE ONE AS COMPUTERS HAVE ALWAYS. CODEBASE ONBOARDING IS A NUMBER ISSUE TO 
PROJECTS & MAINTENANCE. DEV-CORE DOES NOT REQUIRE THE USERS
AWARENESS OF MODULES NAMES. DEV-CORE IS A CONTEXTUAL JACKPOT.
ANY SEASONED DEVELOPER FOR EXAMPLE WOULD REALIZE 
DEPENDENCY INJECTION MANAGEMENT IS ESSENTIAL. ANY SEASONED DEVELOPER
WOULD REALIZE COMPUTER SCIENCE BACKED ALGORITHMS & DATASTRUCTURES
ARE ESSENTIAL. ANY SEASONED DEVELOPER WOULD REALIZE TESTING & BENCHMARKING
SOFTWARE ARE ESEENTIAL TO DEVELOPMENT. THOSE WHO DO NOT, NEED THERE MEMORY CHECKED.
REMEMBER THE NUMBER CODING RULE. "DONT REPEAT YOURSELF"


THE MOST IMPORT MODULES DEV CORE HAS TO OFFER ARE "FUNC" & "CLAS".
THEY BOTH OFFER WIDELY SOFTWARE ARCHITECTS SOLUTIONS BAKED INTO THE SOFTWARE 
AND EASILY LEARNABLE TINKERING WITH CONFIGURATIONS. INSTEAD OF REMEMBERING 
EVERYTHING BY NAME, THESE MODULES ACT AS THE FACE, THE DIRECTOR, THE POINTER 
TO DEMAND SOLUTIONS AN WHEN THEY DON'T WE'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE ONE FOR THE WORLD.
